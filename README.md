Collection of tools written in Object Pascal. All tools are intended to be useable in Lazarus and Delphi, Linux and Windows 32 and 64 bit builds. Directories are created and updated as I feel the desire to write new types and units to suit my own personal needs. There is no focus or direction here. There's very likely nothing here that hasn't been done before and done better. Oh well.

TDynArray
- Similar to C++'s std::vector
